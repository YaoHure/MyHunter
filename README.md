# MyHunter
In this project, the goal is to  make a small video game based on the rules of Duck Hunt.
The basic rules for the my_hunter are as follows:
            • the player is a hunter who shoots ducks. 
            • ducks must appear on the screen and move from one side to another. 
            • the player can click on them to shoot them.
            
The other goal of the project is to be able to manage inputs from the user and to display animated sprites are key skills  to develop basic games.
